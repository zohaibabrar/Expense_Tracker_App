## Expense Tracker App :dollar:

A new Flutter project with local database connection using Hive.

To keep track of transactions more accessible, it's better to have a dashboard display that will give a detailed view of all critical transactions, including the total amount saved. With the help of the Flutter framework, I built a responsive dashboard connected locally to the Hive database.
